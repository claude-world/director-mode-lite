# Task Planning

Create a detailed execution plan for the current task.

## Process

1. **Analyze Requirements**
   - What is the goal?
   - What are the constraints?
   - What resources are available?

2. **Break Down Tasks**
   - Decompose into specific, actionable steps
   - Each task should be completable independently
   - Estimate relative complexity (small/medium/large)

3. **Create Task List**
   - Use TodoWrite tool to track progress
   - Mark priorities and dependencies
   - Keep tasks granular

4. **Identify Risks**
   - What could go wrong?
   - What are the unknowns?
   - What needs clarification?

## Task Template

```markdown
## Task: [Task Name]

### Goal
[What this task achieves]

### Steps
1. [ ] [Step 1]
2. [ ] [Step 2]
3. [ ] [Step 3]

### Dependencies
- Requires: [other tasks]
- Blocks: [dependent tasks]

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Criterion 1]
- [ ] [Criterion 2]
```

## Guidelines

- Keep tasks small (completable in one session)
- Be specific about acceptance criteria
- Identify dependencies early
- Update plan as you learn more
